# Text-to-Speech-Web-API
Web Based API which converts Text to Speech.
creating a Web App that converts text to speech incorporated to it sounds pretty cool, and if all these fascilities are availbale without the interference of any third party library then it is even more easy to implement.The web speech API provides with basic tools that can be used to create interactive web apps with voice data enabled. We have created a basic interface that has a simple box contains our text input section where we will write the text, and two sliders which manipulate the  rate of voice and also its pitch. Then we have a drop-down menu that contains all the supported languages with regions mentioned with it.
